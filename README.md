# Isaac Sim Playground

This repository is my personal space for experimenting and learning with NVIDIA Isaac Sim. The goal is to explore robotics simulation, AI integration, and 3D robot environments in a hands-on way.

## Overview

- Test robot control, navigation, and perception in simulation  
- Explore AI/ML applications with virtual robots  
- Learn NVIDIA Omniverse
